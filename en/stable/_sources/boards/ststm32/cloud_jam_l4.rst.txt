RushUp Cloud-JAM L4
===================

.. contents::

Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_ststm32`: The STM32 family of 32-bit Flash MCUs based on the ARM Cortex-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers a 32-bit product range that combines very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low-power, low-voltage operation, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - STM32L476RGT6
  * - **Frequency**
    - 80MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 1MB
  * - **RAM**
    - 128KB
  * - **Vendor**
    - `RushUp <https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-L476RG/?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``cloud_jam_l4`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:cloud_jam_l4]
  platform = ststm32
  board = cloud_jam_l4

You can override default RushUp Cloud-JAM L4 settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `cloud_jam_l4.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/blob/master/boards/cloud_jam_l4.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:cloud_jam_l4]
  platform = ststm32
  board = cloud_jam_l4

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = stm32l476rgt6

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 80000000L


Uploading
---------
RushUp Cloud-JAM L4 supports the following uploading protocols:

* ``blackmagic``
* ``cmsis-dap``
* ``jlink``
* ``mbed``
* ``stlink``

Default protocol is ``stlink``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:cloud_jam_l4]
  platform = ststm32
  board = cloud_jam_l4

  upload_protocol = stlink

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

RushUp Cloud-JAM L4 has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.
