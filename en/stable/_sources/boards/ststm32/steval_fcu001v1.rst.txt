STEVAL-FCU001V1 Flight controller unit evaluation board
=======================================================

.. contents::

Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_ststm32`: The STM32 family of 32-bit Flash MCUs based on the ARM Cortex-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers a 32-bit product range that combines very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low-power, low-voltage operation, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - STM32F401CCU6
  * - **Frequency**
    - 84MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 256KB
  * - **RAM**
    - 64KB
  * - **Vendor**
    - `ST <https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-fcu001v1.html?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``steval_fcu001v1`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:steval_fcu001v1]
  platform = ststm32
  board = steval_fcu001v1

You can override default STEVAL-FCU001V1 Flight controller unit evaluation board settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `steval_fcu001v1.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/blob/master/boards/steval_fcu001v1.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:steval_fcu001v1]
  platform = ststm32
  board = steval_fcu001v1

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = stm32f401ccu6

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 84000000L


Uploading
---------
STEVAL-FCU001V1 Flight controller unit evaluation board supports the following uploading protocols:

* ``blackmagic``
* ``cmsis-dap``
* ``jlink``
* ``stlink``

Default protocol is ``stlink``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:steval_fcu001v1]
  platform = ststm32
  board = steval_fcu001v1

  upload_protocol = stlink

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

STEVAL-FCU001V1 Flight controller unit evaluation board does not have on-board debug probe and **IS NOT READY** for debugging. You will need to use/buy one of external probe listed below.
