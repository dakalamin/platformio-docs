TI-ICDI
=======

Tivaâ„¢ C Series evaluation and reference design kits provide an integrated
In-Circuit Debug Interface (ICDI) which allows programming and debugging of
the onboard C Series microcontroller.
Official reference can be found `here <http://www.ti.com/tool/stellaris_icdi_drivers?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=docs>`__.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure debugging tool using :ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in
:ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = ti-icdi

If you would like to use this tool for firmware uploading, please change
upload protocol:

.. code-block:: ini

    [env:myenv]
    platform = ...
    board = ...
    debug_tool = ti-icdi
    upload_protocol = ti-icdi

More options:

* :ref:`projectconf_section_env_debug`
* :ref:`projectconf_section_env_upload`

Drivers
-------

:Windows:
  Please "USB Driver Installation" guide for your board.

:Mac:
  Not required.

:Linux:
  Please install "udev" rules :ref:`platformio_udev_rules`. If you already installed
  them before, please check that your rules are up-to-date or repeat steps.
