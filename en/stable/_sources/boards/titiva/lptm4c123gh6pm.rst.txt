TI LaunchPad (Tiva C) w/ tm4c123 (80MHz)
========================================

.. contents::

Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_titiva`: Texas Instruments TM4C12x MCUs offer the industrys most popular ARM Cortex-M4 core with scalable memory and package options, unparalleled connectivity peripherals, advanced application functions, industry-leading analog integration, and extensive software solutions.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - LPTM4C123GH6PM
  * - **Frequency**
    - 80MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 256KB
  * - **RAM**
    - 32KB
  * - **Vendor**
    - `TI <http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-connected-ek-tm4c123gxl.html?utm_source=platformio.org&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``lptm4c123gh6pm`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:lptm4c123gh6pm]
  platform = titiva
  board = lptm4c123gh6pm

You can override default TI LaunchPad (Tiva C) w/ tm4c123 (80MHz) settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `lptm4c123gh6pm.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-titiva/blob/master/boards/lptm4c123gh6pm.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:lptm4c123gh6pm]
  platform = titiva
  board = lptm4c123gh6pm

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = lptm4c123gh6pm

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 80000000L

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

TI LaunchPad (Tiva C) w/ tm4c123 (80MHz) has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.
